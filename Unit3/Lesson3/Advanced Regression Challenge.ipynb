clean and all data points are numeric data already. It will save us lots of time to clean the data. According to the description of the data set, we will drop gameID, creation time, and season ID from our regression model. Actually we could have drop champion ID, summor spell ID, and ban ID as well, since they are champion ID and skill ID from Riot database. However, I will keep these columns here for the regression model because I want to see how these irrelevant data will effect our model.
